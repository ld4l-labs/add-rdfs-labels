# add-rdfs-labels
Add rdfs:label value to entities output by bib2lod converter that have no rdfs:label.

Uses LD4L-O v1. Needs to be adapted to LD4L-O v2 recommendations. 

This project may be of interest to LD4P groups wishing to ingest data into VitroLib, in order to add labels that VitroLib requires for display purposes but that are not generated by the LD4L Labs converter.
